## Definition

The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to evolve independently. This means changes can be made to the abstraction (e.g. user interface) and the implementation (e.g. specific platforms) without affecting each other.

## Key Concepts

- **Abstraction:**
    - Defines the higher-level abstraction layer.
    - Uses the `Implementor` interface to delegate operations to a concrete implementation.

    Example: The `Shape` class representing different shapes.

- **RefinedAbstraction:**
    - A concrete implementation of the abstraction.
    
    Example: The `Circle` class inheriting from `Shape`.

- **Implementor:**
    - An interface that defines operations to be performed by the implementation.
    
    Example: The `IColor` interface.

- **ConcreteImplementor:**
    - Provides a concrete implementation of the `Implementor` interface.
    
    Example: The `Red` and `Green` classes implementing `IColor`.

## Common Uses of the Bridge Pattern

- Developing applications that need to work on multiple platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS).
- Separating business logic from user interface logic.
- When the implementation requires multiple independent dimensions of development (e.g., different shapes and different colors in graphics).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of the Bridge Pattern

- **Advantages:**
    - Separation of abstraction from implementation.
    - Easier code development and maintenance.
    - Improved flexibility and extensibility.

- **Disadvantages:**
    - Can introduce additional complexity in simple cases.
    - Requires a well-thought-out class structure.
