# Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

## Abstract Factory
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Builder
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Factory Method
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Prototype
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

## Singleton
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
